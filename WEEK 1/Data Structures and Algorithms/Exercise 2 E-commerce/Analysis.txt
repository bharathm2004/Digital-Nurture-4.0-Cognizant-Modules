Time Complexity Comparison: Linear Search vs Binary Search

1. Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) → When the element is at the beginning.

Average Case: O(n) → On average, half the array must be searched.

Worst Case: O(n) → When the element is at the end or not present at all.

Sorting Needed: No sorting required.

Suitable For: Small datasets or unsorted data.

2. Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) → If the element is exactly in the middle.

Average Case: O(log n) → Each step cuts the search range in half.

Worst Case: O(log n) → Logarithmic time even in worst scenario.

Sorting Needed: Yes, data must be sorted.

Suitable For: Large, sorted datasets.

Which is More Suitable for an E-Commerce Platform?
For an e-commerce platform, where product searches are very frequent and performance matters:

Binary Search is more suitable if the data is sorted (by product ID or name), because it is much faster for large datasets — O(log n) vs. O(n).

In real-world systems, search performance is usually handled with indexing, binary search trees, or hashing to optimize performance even further.

So, Binary Search (or even better, more advanced structures) is the preferred choice for fast, scalable search on an e-commerce platform.
