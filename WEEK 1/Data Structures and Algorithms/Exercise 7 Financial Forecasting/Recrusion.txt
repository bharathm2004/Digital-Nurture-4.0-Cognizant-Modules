1. Understand Recursive Algorithms
Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself to solve a problem.

A recursive function has:

Base case: Stops the recursion.

Recursive case: Breaks the problem into smaller subproblems.

Why use recursion?

It simplifies problems like factorial, Fibonacci series, and tree traversal.

It replaces complex loops with simpler code.
